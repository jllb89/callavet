here you have my API / Service Diagram & Flows, based on this and the tests you just ran, are we going in the correct direction or are we missing something?

Notes

Web App is blended: “/” is acquisition + immediate Start Consult; “/app/*” is the authenticated experience.

Admin is separate (Next.js) for ops: vet onboarding, refunds/credits, pricing controls, payouts.

Stripe Webhooks are isolated (Express) and push normalized events to Gateway.

Supabase provides Auth, Postgres (with RLS), and Storage; hybrid search via tsvector + pgvector.

Chat (WS) and Video (LiveKit) are services the Gateway orchestrates (entitlement check, open/close, finalize usage).

AI Workers backfill embeddings and write summaries/care plans via async jobs.

2) Key Runtime Flows (sequence)
2.1 Signup / Auth
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User (Web)
  participant SB as Supabase Auth
  participant GW as Gateway API
  participant DB as Postgres (RLS)
  U->>SB: Sign up / Sign in (email/OAuth)
  SB-->>U: JWT (sb-access-token)
  U->>GW: Authenticated request with JWT
  GW->>DB: Verify via auth.uid() under RLS
  DB-->>GW: Authorized rows (RLS enforced)
  GW-->>U: 200 + user profile/subscription snapshot

2.2 Checkout / Membership
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User (Web)
  participant GW as Gateway API
  participant ST as Stripe
  participant WH as Webhooks Ingest
  participant DB as Postgres

  U->>GW: POST /subscriptions/checkout (plan_code)
  GW->>ST: Create Checkout Session
  ST-->>U: Redirect to hosted checkout

  ST-->>WH: webhook: invoice.paid / checkout.session.completed
  WH->>GW: normalized event (customer, sub, status, period)
  GW->>DB: UPSERT user_subscriptions, open subscription_usage period
  GW-->>U: (optional) Notif/email; Web pulls status on reload

2.3 Start Session (Chat or Video)
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User (Web)
  participant GW as Gateway
  participant DB as Postgres (RLS)
  participant ENT as Entitlements (DB funcs)
  participant CHAT as Chat WS
  participant LVK as LiveKit

  U->>GW: POST /sessions/start {mode, pet_id, text}
  GW->>DB: SELECT active subscription (RLS)
  GW->>DB: fn_reserve_chat() or fn_reserve_video()  (atomic)
  alt mode == "chat"
    GW->>CHAT: create room/token
    CHAT-->>GW: room info
  else mode == "video"
    GW->>LVK: create room/token
    LVK-->>GW: room info
  end
  GW->>DB: INSERT chat_sessions (status=active)
  GW-->>U: 200 {sessionId, room/token}

2.4 End Session & Finalize Usage
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant GW as Gateway
  participant DB as Postgres
  participant ENT as Entitlements

  U->>GW: POST /sessions/end {sessionId}
  GW->>DB: UPDATE chat_sessions (ended_at, status)
  GW->>DB: fn_commit_consumption(consumption_id)  # finalize count
  GW-->>U: 200 {rating_url}

2.5 Overage (no entitlement left)
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant GW as Gateway
  participant ST as Stripe
  participant WH as Webhooks
  participant DB as Postgres

  U->>GW: /sessions/start (no units left)
  GW->>ST: Create PaymentIntent/Checkout for one-off
  ST-->>U: Pay flow
  ST-->>WH: payment_intent.succeeded
  WH->>GW: normalized payment event
  GW->>DB: INSERT payments; allow session; reserve unit ad-hoc
  GW-->>U: proceed to room

2.6 Cancellation at Period End
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant GW as Gateway
  participant ST as Stripe
  participant DB as Postgres

  U->>GW: POST /subscriptions/cancel
  GW->>ST: Update sub: cancel_at_period_end=true
  GW->>DB: SET cancel_at_period_end=true
  Note over U,GW: Access remains until current_period_end

2.7 Embeddings Backfill (AI Worker)
sequenceDiagram
  participant WRK as AI Worker
  participant DB as Postgres
  loop every 5 min
    WRK->>DB: SELECT rows WHERE embedding IS NULL LIMIT 100
    WRK->>WRK: get embeddings (1536-dim)
    WRK->>DB: UPDATE ... SET embedding=$vec
  end
  WRK->>DB: ANALYZE after batches

2.8 Hybrid Search (KB / Notes / Messages)
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User/Vet/Admin
  participant GW as Gateway
  participant DB as Postgres

  U->>GW: GET /search?q="colico caballo"
  GW->>DB: Lexical (tsvector ES/EN)
  GW->>DB: Semantic (embedding <=> query_vec)
  GW->>GW: Score fusion, rank, paginate
  GW-->>U: Results (ids, snippets, score)

3) Data Plane & Security (recap)

Supabase Postgres: RLS enabled on all user data tables; JWT mapped via auth.uid().

Hybrid search: es_en_tsv() for bilingual tsvector + pgvector (1536) with IVFFLAT (lists=100), tuned later.

Storage: buckets cases, attachments with signed URLs from Gateway.

Stripe Webhooks: isolated service → normalized payload → Gateway updates user_subscriptions, subscription_usage, payments, invoices.

Entitlements: DB functions fn_current_usage, fn_reserve_chat, fn_reserve_video, fn_commit_consumption, fn_release_consumption are the single source of truth.

4) Endpoints (representative)

POST /subscriptions/checkout → Stripe Checkout session (plan)

POST /subscriptions/cancel → cancel at period end

GET /subscriptions/usage → current period snapshot (included/consumed/overage)

POST /sessions/start → entitlement reserve + room token (chat/video)

POST /sessions/end → finalize consumption

GET /search → hybrid KB/notes/messages search

GET /centers/near → nearby partner/clinics (lexical + geo filters)
